<p><strong>Hey there 👋</strong>
I&rsquo;m Rahul. I&rsquo;m a Senior here at UT.</p>
<p>I moved around a lot as a kid, but I&rsquo;m originally from Canada 🇨🇦.</p>
<p>I moved to Texas around Sophmore year of Highschool where I went to Tyler Legacy HS in Tyler, Texas (200 miles east of Dallas).</p>
<p>In highschool, I was part of the Technology Student Association where me and a couple of friends participated in the cybersecurity competitions. I had fun in that club because we were able to travel around to compete. I also liked UIL CS.
If I hadn&rsquo;t gotten into UT, I wouldv&rsquo;e probably gone to UBC (British Columbia). That was the only Candian university I got into.</p>
