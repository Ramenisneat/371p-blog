<p><strong>What&rsquo;s up 👋</strong></p>
<p>The Problem from this week was something that I found interesting. I used to do somewhat competitive programming in highschool but it&rsquo;s been a while, so I feel like I lost that &ldquo;mind muscle&rdquo; connection of solving these kind of problems.
So, these weekly problems have been very good for me to regain that skill and I have been realizing that usefulness of having that kind of problem solving strategy for everyday life.</p>
<p>I think that important skill is the skill of reducing a problem down to its very core and abstracting the solution. This helps you eliminate useless logic that may be systematically correct, but not needed for the problem at hand.
I feel like in this week&rsquo;s 3-puzzle problem, it is very easy for my CS-oriented mind to default to a BFS sort of search of all board states until we find the target. But, I felt very lazy to code a solution of that caliber and thought it would be too long winded for a competitive programming type question. The restricted board size gave me a clue, and after trying out some random board states on a piece of paper, it was clear that not all board states are solvable. You can only apply a few legal transformations which essentially meant moving a tile to its target position takes the manhattan distance number of steps between the two points. It was quick to code up and it worked.
Yes, if you were to extrapolate it onto a bigger board or would need to weed out unsolvable boards, this solution wouldn&rsquo;t work at all. But it solves the problem at hand perfectly, so I think that&rsquo;s a good lesson.</p>
<p>I found this week&rsquo;s paper interesting as well but I do not agree with some of it&rsquo;s extreme measures. I felt the same with last week&rsquo;s CI paper. I mostly like the medium version of these practices.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t consume a lot of tech related stuff this week, so my pick-of-the-week is my lightning mcqueen CRT  (kachow) I got over the break. Except it didn&rsquo;t came with an remote, there&rsquo;s no manual input and I can&rsquo;t find a working universal remote code :/</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s up 👋</strong></p>
<p>I hope your week has gone well. Can&rsquo;t believe we had a winter storm less than a week ago with all this sunlight shining straight into my eyeballs constantly. Honestly, though I am very much enjoying the cooler weather for once.</p>
<p>About this week in this class, the project surprised me. I feel like with a lot of other classes at UT, projects usually comprised of just completing some test cases and your good. However, there were a lot of moving parts with this project with not just the HackerRank test cases, but the unit tests, UAT, gitlab CI pipeline etc. I feel like I am the sort of person that just complete my work in one shot untill it works. So, having to continously check myself to commit and close issues and etc. took me a second.</p>
<p>The assigned paper about Continous Integration was an interesting read. I agree with all of the points the author made about the effectiveness for CI, but the workflow feels a little too idealistic for me. Like, I understand when all the devs are working properly, making meaningful changes to the code and being communicative, CI with changes everyday works well. But I feel like the real world is never like that. I feel like many features take much longer than single commits to get right, most of the time it can take multiple days and commits, but with devs constantly breaking away from devleopment to integrate their sloppy code with other sloppy code can lead to issues. Yes, in a perfect world this is a non issue, but that&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s not a perfect world. I feel like some devs like the idea of eliminating every ounce of unproductivity from their work, but I think chasing that rabbit hole leads to more problems than solutions. I think having the expectation for fast commits and passed test cases can lead to more hiccups in some cases. I guess what I am trying to say is that there is always going to be some &ldquo;slop&rdquo; and that we should embrace this &ldquo;slop&rdquo;. Instead of pushing out commits hourly with whatever small change we have made, a more substantial change that can be done in a workday or a couple of workdays, with the afforded time we can verify is proper and then push onto our main. I think I like a more middleground approach to CI/CD than what I see in this paper.</p>
<p>Sorry if that was a bit rambly.</p>
<p>Oh and for my pick-of-the-week this week, is <code>webhook.site</code>. I work with a bunch of microcontrollers in my free time and like doing IOT projects, which require you to build APIs and such to get working. With micrcontrollers, sometimes that&rsquo;s the only way to send viable way to diagnose if it&rsquo;s functioning properly since you have such a limited Serial interface to work with. For example if you are doing some sort of image manipulation on a controller, the simplest way to see the results of that is to spin a webserver and have the controller post the data to that API. But working with UT&rsquo;s network can be a pain in regards with local communication, so if I quickly need to verify functionality on a project before creating a central backend to handle requests, I like using this site to handle incoming requests and see if data is being transmitted properly. ig, there is a concern with whether information sent to the site is stored or not, but I genuinely just do dumb stuff with it, so I don&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s up 👋</strong></p>
<p>I hope y&rsquo;alls winter storm is going well. I&rsquo;m having fun sliding around in my truck and getting flanked on all sides by 15mph drivers. I get it, it&rsquo;s scary but let me pass, pleaseee 😭</p>

Honestly, I haven't done too much in regards with this class this week. I barely started with the project, so i'll hunker down tonight and make a dent in it 🙇
<p>I think one aspect of this class that &ldquo;surprised&rdquo; me was how structured everything is. As in the software side of things. It&rsquo;s very professional as in how an actual software development project would be structured as. I&rsquo;ve done some professional software work before, but it has always been one off projects, so the repos were not as meticulously crafted as I see in this class. There are some things I disagree with, like some lines in the makefile, but overall I see it&rsquo;s utility.</p>
<p>The Kattis problem this week was also pretty interesting. It took me a while to understand what the question is actually asking for and I had to think of a solution that didn&rsquo;t have a huge time complexity. The solution clicked for me when I saw that in the sample input/output, the second cycle always had fewer steps to the meeting point. I used hashmaps for the first time in c++ to solve this problem, took me a second to understand the API. Then I wasted a submission when I used a orderedmap vs an unorderedmap. The orderedmap added a lot to the runtime to sort the keys, when that&rsquo;s simply not needed for this problem. I like the simplicity of my solution and how plain it is, but I kind of feel like it&rsquo;s &ldquo;bulky&rdquo; in a sense that I am using hashmaps for a real simple cycle representation. I think you could get by with just a memorymap with pointers cause the keys are always positive integers. Actually, just typing that out solidified it in my mind that it would work, but I don&rsquo;t particularly agree with a solution like that cause it would be slightly harder to understand the code.</p>
<p>Okie, now for my pick-of-the-week, I would have to say it&rsquo;s the vscode extension <code>latex-workshop</code>. Its a nice way to compile latex documents to pdfs in the vscode environment and I find it easier than working with overleaf on a seperate browser tab. It is kind of a pain to get it working, but I still like it</p>

<p><strong>Hey there 👋</strong>
I&rsquo;m Rahul. I&rsquo;m a Senior here at UT.</p>
<p>I moved around a lot as a kid, but I&rsquo;m originally from Canada 🇨🇦.</p>
<p>I moved to Texas around Sophmore year of Highschool where I went to Tyler Legacy HS in Tyler, Texas (200 miles east of Dallas).</p>
<p>In highschool, I was part of the Technology Student Association where me and a couple of friends participated in the cybersecurity competitions. I had fun in that club because we were able to travel around to compete. I also liked UIL CS.
If I hadn&rsquo;t gotten into UT, I wouldv&rsquo;e probably gone to UBC (British Columbia). That was the only Candian university I got into.</p>
<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t gotten into CS at UT, I maybe would have gone for an engineering degree like MechE or ECE.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in this class because I wanted to have more formal real world CS skills. This class advertised topics of OOP, CI/CD, building automation which I&rsquo;ve always known how to do but never in a real structured and formal manner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used C++ before, but it has mainly been localized to Arduino/microcontroller development for work. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I know the language in the sense it was made to be used.</p>
<p>The first few lectures are going well. There are a couple of new things i&rsquo;ve been introduced to like gtest, optionals, etc. The first project seems daunting in a sense that it&rsquo;s not just as simple as completing the coding aspect. Other than that, everything seems fine.</p>
<p>The cold calling is a bit odd. Apparently, I was called on the second day and I didn&rsquo;t hear my name at all. I guess, I am just not used to having my name randomly called out since Highschool. It&rsquo;ll take a sec to adjust to.</p>
<p>Something that made me happy this week is the Costco Chicken Bake, selling for $2.99.</p>
<p><img src="../chicken.jpeg" alt="Chicki bake"></p>
<p>My Pick of the week would be the software I used to make this blog, hugo. Its a pretty quick static site generator that can render markdown. I can use markdown pretty easily to make the content and then using a theme I can make the site function well and look pretty. I can deploy the site pretty easily using github pages workflows.</p>
