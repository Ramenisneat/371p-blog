## Blog Entry no°1

**Hey there 👋**
I'm Rahul. I'm a Senior here at UT.

I moved around a lot as a kid, but I'm originally from Canada 🇨🇦.

I moved to Texas around Sophmore year of Highschool where I went to Tyler Legacy HS in Tyler, Texas (200 miles east of Dallas).

In highschool, I was part of the Technology Student Association where me and a couple of friends participated in the cybersecurity competitions. I had fun in that club because we were able to travel around to compete. I also liked UIL CS.
If I hadn't gotten into UT, I wouldv'e probably gone to UBC (British Columbia). That was the only Candian university I got into.

If I hadn't gotten into CS at UT, I maybe would have gone for an engineering degree like MechE or ECE.

I'm in this class because I wanted to have more formal real world CS skills. This class advertised topics of OOP, CI/CD, building automation which I've always known how to do but never in a real structured and formal manner.

I've used C++ before, but it has mainly been localized to Arduino/microcontroller development for work. I wouldn't say I know the language in the sense it was made to be used.

The first few lectures are going well. There are a couple of new things i've been introduced to like gtest, optionals, etc. The first project seems daunting in a sense that it's not just as simple as completing the coding aspect. Other than that, everything seems fine.

The cold calling is a bit odd. Apparently, I was called on the second day and I didn't hear my name at all. I guess, I am just not used to having my name randomly called out since Highschool. It'll take a sec to adjust to.

Something that made me happy this week is the Costco Chicken Bake, selling for $2.99.

My Pick of the week would be the software I used to make this blog, hugo. Its a pretty quick static site generator that can render markdown. I can use markdown pretty easily to make the content and then using a theme I can make the site function well and look pretty. I can deploy the site pretty easily using github pages workflows.
